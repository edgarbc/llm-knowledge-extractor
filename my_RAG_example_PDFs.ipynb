During the same period, medical image analysis also made re-\\nmarkable breakthroughs by applying deep neural networks to solve tasks such\\nas segmentation, structure detection, and computer-aided diagnosis (detailed re-\\nview available at [20,27]). However, one current limitation of medical imaging\\nprojects is the lack of availability of large datasets. Medical data are costly and\\nlaborious to collect, and privacy concerns create challenges to data sharing by\\nrestricting publicly available medical datasets to up to a few thousand examples.\\nThis limitation creates a bottleneck on models’ generalizability and hampers the\\nrate at which cutting-edge methods are deployed in the clinical routine.\\nGenerating synthetic data with privacy guarantees provides a promising al-\\nternative, allowing meaningful research to be carried out at scale [15,14,33].\\nTogether with traditional data augmentation techniques (e.g., geometric trans-\\nformations), these synthetic data could complement real data to dramatically\\nincrease the training set of machine learning models. Generative models learn\\nthe probability density function underlying the data they are trained on and\\ncan create realistic representations of examples which are diﬀerent from the\\nones present in the training data by sampling from the learned distribution.\\nHowever, generating meaningful synthetic data is not easy, especially when con-\\nsidering complex organs like the brain.\\nNowadays, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been applied in\\nvariousﬁeldstocreatesyntheticimages,producingrealisticandclearimagesand\\nachieving impressive performance [7,32]. In the medical ﬁeld, for example, [17]\\ncombine variational autoencoders with GANs to generate various modalities of\\nwhole brain volumes from a small training set and achieved a better performance\\ncompared to several baselines. However, since their study resized the images to a\\nsmall volume before training, with a size of 64 ×64×64 voxels, their synthetic\\nmedical images did not replicate many essential ﬁner details. In addition, due to\\nthe prevalence of 3D high-resolution data in the ﬁeld, researchers tend to have\\ntheir models restrained by the amount of GPU memory available. To mitigate\\nthis problem, [31] proposed a 3D GAN with a hierarchical structure which is able\\nto generate a low-resolution version of the image and anchor the generation of\\nhigh-resolution sub-volumes on it. With this approach, the authors were able to\\ngenerate impressive realistic 3D thorax CT and brain MRI with resolutions up\\nto 256 ×256×256 voxels. Despite generating great interest, GANs still come\\nwith inherent challenges, such as being notoriously unstable during training and\\nfailing to converge or to capture the variability of the generated data due to\\nmode collapse issues [16].\\nRecently, diﬀusion models caught the attention of the machine learning com-\\nmunity by showing promising results when synthesizing natural images. They\\nhave rivalled GANs in sample quality [9] while building upon a solid theoretical\\nfoundation. Not only have they reported impressive photorealism unconditioned\\nimages, but they have also been used to create images conditioned in classes and\\ntext sentences (using techniques like classiﬁer-free guidance [13]), with excep-\\ntional results on models like Latent Diﬀusion Models [23], DALLE 2 [22], and\\nImagen [25].', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
